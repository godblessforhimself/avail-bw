	DietTopp is a tool that estimates the end-to-end link capacity as
	well as the end-to-end available bandwidth. To get accurate results
	the path should not contain more than one bottleneck (i.e. more
	than one link that will be congested when DietTopp is measuring).

	Follow the steps below to install and run DietTopp
	1) run ./configure in the DietTopp/configure_dir/ directory
	2) run make in the DietTopp/ directory
	3) "server" and "measure" are the two executables created, run 
	   "server" on the receiving machine and "measure" on the sending
	   machine
